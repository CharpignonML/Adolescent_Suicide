# Adolescent_Suicide

Two datasets are needed and provided as .txt files in this repository: 
1. Underlying_Cause_Death_Suicide_All_1999_2019.txt
2. Underlying_Cause_Death_Suicide_Adolescents_1999_2019.txt

Running the .R script should only require the "ggplot2" library. You can load it using the following commands: require(ggplot2) or require(ggplot2).

Within the script, you should incorporate the name of the folder/repository where you would have stored the .txt files.
